**[Project Notebook](https://github.com/trezaim13/Practicum100-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales-Funnel-and-Testing/Funnel-Study-and-Testing.ipynb)**

This study is conducted for the benefice of the marketing department at **an online store**. We have compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue.
**The goal from this study will be to prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.**

The study will be conducted in two big parts : The first part will consist of prioritizing the hypotheses. The second part will consist of an A/B testing analysis. For this study we have the following datasets :
* A dataset of hypotheses with the reach, impact, confidence and effort parameters,
* A dataset of orders from each group,
* A dataset of visitors from each group.

### Description of the data

Data used in the first part of the project :
* Hypotheses — brief descriptions of the hypotheses
* Reach — user reach, on a scale of one to ten
* Impact — impact on users, on a scale of one to ten
* Confidence — confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten
* Effort — the resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.

Data used in the second part of the project :
* transactionId — order identifier
* visitorId — identifier of the user who placed the order
* date — of the order
* revenue — from the order
* group — the A/B test group that the user belongs to
* date — date
* group — A/B test group
* visits — the number of visits on the date specified in the A/B test group specified
