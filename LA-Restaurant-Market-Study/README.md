# **LA Restaurant Market Study**
A client has decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so the client and their partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will they be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
As a data analyst, I was asked you to prepare some market research. For this reasearch, I will use open-source data on restaurants in LA.

### Description of the data

rest_data table:
object_name — establishment name
chain — chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)
