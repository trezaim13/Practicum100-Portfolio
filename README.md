# Hiba Asselman - Data Analysis Portfolio

**This repository groups the projects I have worked on during my studies with Practicum100 by Yandex.**

Hello, my name is hiba and I recently graduated the exclusive Data Analysis bootcamp "Practicum100" by Yandex. I was chosen among 100 other students, from 4000 applicants to complete this 9-month intensive online program designed to be trained to become successful Data Analysts. <br>

The following projects were part of a semi-monthly assesment that we had to succeed in order to advance in the course. And they will help you see that I have developed a solid foundation in Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis of Data, A/B Testing, Data Visualization and the basics of Machine Learning. You will also be able to see, and that through my previous academics, that I can write an insightful, well organized report with thourough observations and conclusions. <br>
